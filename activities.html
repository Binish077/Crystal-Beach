                <br><h2>Sports and underwater activities</h2>
                Activities that do not involve motors such as snorkeling, surfing, or rowing are great
                ways to enjoy the ocean without causing noise pollution.<br>(Image by Marek Okon)</li>

                    <br><h2>Use Designated Paths</strong></h2>
                    If you see any paved ways or wooden walkways, use those to roam on the beach rather
                    than sand dunes. The dunes are used as habitats for birds and rare plants, so it is best
                    to leave them as they are.<br>(Image by Rachel Cooper)</li>

                    <br><h2>Wildlife</h2><br>
                    Beaches are diverse ecosystems of their own, so you could get the chance to see some
                    pretty interesting wildlife during your visit! Ensure that you keep yourself at a distance 
                    however, and avoid feeding them your food. The wonderful creatures' digestive systems may not be
                    able to digest human food and may make them dependent on humans as a food source.<br>(Image by Thomas Lipke)</li>

                    <br><h2>Fishing</h2><br>
                    Ask a local fisher to fish if they would like to fish with you. You may learn some
                    interesting information about the beach you are on and can catch fish of the season. If you wish to 
                    dine on seafood, this is a great opportunity to go to local restaurants that serve seasonal fish and
                    try new cuisines.<br>(Image by Amit Uikey)</li>
