            <ul>
                <li class="sub-item"><strong>Avoid Plastics!</strong><br>
                This is super important! Plastics can end up in the ocean and harm marine wildlife,
                so try to avoid bringing food wrapped in plastic packaging or single use plastic water bottles. Alternatives
                include reusable metal tumblers, aluminium foil, or paper packaging.</li>
                <br>
                <li class="sub-item"><strong>Use Mineral Sunscreens</strong><br>
                SPF is important to protect your skin from suburns and harmful UV radiation.
                Chemical sunscreens have been linked to coral bleaching due to ingredients such as oxybenzone and
                octinoxate (these chemicals are harmful to human beings too) so use mineral sunscreens instead and stay in the shade
                for a cool summer! :)</li>
                <br>
                <li class="sub-item"><strong>Try Leveling Out the Sand Before You Leave</strong><br>
                Surprisingly enough, variation in sand that may seem minute to us are enormous hurdles for baby turtles trying
                to find their way to the see, so make to to level and sandcastles and foot prints you may create before you leave.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li class="sub-item"><strong>Please Do Not Collect Souvenirs!</strong><br>
                As tempting as they may seem, sand and shells, among other natural items, should not be taken away from where 
                they once were. This is because these items are part of the coastal ecosystem that makes up the beach. Ecosystems are 
                delicate structures and any disturbance in them can affect other species.</li><br><br>
